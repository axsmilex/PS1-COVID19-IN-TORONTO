 Abstract In this blog we explore the demographics, geographic, and severity data information for all confirmed and probable cases reported to Toronto Public Health department. We find the general areas where the majority of cases are reported and can imply future trends of how the virus is going to affect Toronto, Ontario. This matters as for which areas to be extra cautious whenever travelling is needed and which age-groups are at the highest risk.</description>
